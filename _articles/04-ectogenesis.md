**Abstract:** Ectogenesis is the conception, embryonic development, and gestation of an organism in an artificial environment external to the body (ecto- meaning “outside” and genesis meaning “origin”). As societies beyond Earth have evolved over the last four generations, they have deployed this technology in various ways. I examine digital artefacts of assisted reproductive technologies on three different extraterrestrial settlements to illuminate those societies’ broader practices. The development of these technologies suggests the endeavours to leave Earth and establish off-world colonies have profoundly shifted what it means to be human in the universe.

## 1\. Baby EVE: The Beginning of Extraterrestrial Ectogenesis

Human populations across eeSPs (Extra-Earth Settlement Planets) demonstrate remarkable heterogeneity. Each settlement has developed its own systems of governance, cultural practices, and norms around reproductive biotechnologies to facilitate an ideal population. This history of human reproduction beyond planet Earth has long fascinated sociologists and philosophers on Settlement M4. The Library of Santernei in Jurten has amassed an impressive archive of inconsistent but illuminating interstellar transmissions from the various eeSPs about other worlds’ uses of ectogenesis—including our ancient, common planet, Earth.

Ectogenesis refers to the use of an artificial womb to gestate offspring. It incorporates all artificial amniotic and placental technologies, as well as more traditional bio-bag models that became popular for partial ectogenesis in Earth Year (eY) 2030. More recent innovations on M4 include bioengineered external uteri, regardless of whether autologous or synthetic endometrial cells were used in construction.<sup>1</sup>

The first successful live birth (“Baby Eve”) using ectogenesis took place on Earth in eY2078 at the Provisional Women’s and Infants’ Research Institute. The event represented the culmination of various reproductive technologies, most notably neonatal incubation, _in vitro _fertilisation, and embryo transfer. Baby Eve (a pseudonym for privacy reasons) was named after the bio-bag systems developed by the Japanese-Australian “EVE” team, an acronym for _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">e</span>x <span style="text-decoration:underline;">v</span>ivo_ uterine <span style="text-decoration:underline;">e</span>nvironment therapy. Teams working concurrently in North America and Zuidham (formerly the Netherlands) developed the tubal separation technique that ultimately led to our ancestors’ success.

Although experimentation with animal ectogenesis had demonstrated proof of concept as early as eY1995, with significant advancements seen from eY2015 onward, legal obstacles delayed human trials until eY2069—the very same year that saw the launch of the _Melody_ and _Hummingbird_ missions that ferried human settlers to worlds beyond Earth for long-term space habitation. Many historians have speculated that without the impetus to sustain off-world population growth and promote genetic variability, ectogenesis research may have been permanently stalled due to ethico-legal concerns. 

From the archives of the Library of Santernei, I follow the practices of ectogenesis in Graybor Colony, Mantel-6α, and our home, Settlement M4. I examined records only after NS12101 and those that were available in Anthropian.<sup>2</sup> I coded each digital artefact’s context (date, voice, style, setting). 

This study fills a gap in the scholarship regarding how human reproductive practices in different settlements have impacted family structures in these societies, providing some data for future investigations regarding genetic diversity and the conservation of evolved traits in geographically divergent human populations. To the author’s knowledge, it is the first study to consider the scientific and ethico-legal development of assisted gestation across three distinct human settlements.



## 2\. Extraterrestrial Settlements & Ectogenesis

How did humans living off-world use ectogenesis technology? What were the initial and planet-specific factors that contributed to the uptake and regulation of ectogenesis? And what are the biological and cultural consequences of these extraterrestrial practices for the future of humans in the cosmos? The three following settlements represent the spectrum of reproductive biotechnology uses beyond Earth:

**Graybor Colony** (P1) where the use of “transhumanist” technologies, including genetic manipulation, artificial gestation, the use of “insideable” implants and augmented prosthetics for offspring etc., was banned through the passing of the UL547T “pro-bionatalist” legislation. Graybor’s population is estimated to be only 3,100-3,300, due to the fact the current settlement only dates back to approximately NS13900. These colonists are considered quite xenophobic as they have appeared unwilling to engage substantially with those from other colonies. Of the three habitations under investigation in this study, Graybor Colony’s environmental conditions are the closest match to Earth.

**Mantel-6α** (P2) where the availability and use of ectogenesis technologies have been restricted to privately funded facilities and subjected to heavy regulation. The population of Mantel-6α is approximately three million (2,958,170 at last census). The settlement was officially founded in NS12451, but records indicate early scout families were established on the site as early as NS12337. 

**Settlement M4** (P3) which allowed the unrestricted use of ectogenesis technology and even provided limited public funding.<sup>3</sup> The population of M4 is approximately one million (988,106 at last census). Population growth was initially stunted due to high cosmic radiation impacting the fertility of settlers and the survival of fetuses. This accounts for the broad acceptance of technologies aimed at mitigating these threats to the settlement’s longevity. 

These three examples consider the impact of unrestricted acceptance or rejection of ectogenesis technologies, as well as limited and broad availability. As such, they provide insight into how regulation and social licensing of reproductive technologies impact if and how they are integrated into human societies. 



## 3\. Graybor Colony, _Artefact 1:_ “Generative Archive.”

_Open letter by early settlers, reconstructed from a defunct Artificial Intelligence recovered from Graybor Colony._

**Artefact 1** is an open letter by the Technologists of the Graybor Colony in NS13513. It is addressed to both the Graybor people’s fellow humans in the universe—us—and future generations on their planet. The transmission was intercepted by an M4 Trawler (ID#2678) in NS16204 and archived in the Library’s system, but we do not know if the technologists’ descendants received the message. That is because the letter protests the very AI system, the “Generative Archive” (GA), that would have preserved the letter. The authors contend that the GA suppressed common knowledge about planet Earth and Graybor settlers, and we can infer that the AI might have intentionally deleted their message. 

In NS13505, long after the original Colony had been established, automated rovers who routinely surveyed Graybor discovered the ruins of the settler’s first landing site. Technologists recovered data from a computer panel that contained the original GA. This AI became the basis for Graybor’s entire operating system—and, the Technologists suspected, the entity that had directed humans’ development and growth on that planet. 

The Generative Archive appears to be an early model adaptable language model AI. The name of this system warrants critical attention: “archive” implies mere storage, whereas “generative” suggests the program had creative ability. Although similar to many AI systems originating on Earth, the GA seems to have been endowed with significant latitude for autonomous decision-making without user (human) input. This appears to have contributed to its degree of deviation from standard operating parameters. 

The letter was clearly intended for a mass media release, although how the authors planned to distribute it is not known. The text disappears as the reader scrolls down—possibly to circumvent the AI from altering or deleting the text. We do not know if their scheme was successful. 

In the letter, the authors vehemently protested the continued reliance of their society on the GA. They accused the system of unauthorised censorship and abuse of power. They claimed that the GA had “continuously suppressed vital knowledge about our own past and our ancestors’ lives on Sole,” and “deliberately mass-deleted an enormous amount of data about ancestral art forms, scientific developments, and political histories.” As the GA was tasked with educating the next generation, its suppression of information for the future colonists would have been easily achievable.

The letter indicates that the authors were almost completely unfamiliar with the ancient mode of human reproduction on Earth, in which offspring (or “Juveniles” as they call them) first developed through corporeal gestation and then are separated from the body of their progenitor through a positive feedback process known as “birth.” They referred to the descriptions of biological gestation in the Hidden Archives as processes that were “clearly intended as metaphors.” 

What protocols did the GA use when instigating batch failures of the ectogenic fetuses before settling on the desired genetic combination to create the initial population? Were the first settlers aware of such events? Were they involved in the decision-making? Did they build the mechanisms of the GA that their ancestors were known to revile? How did these descendants of Earth (or “Sole” as they refer to it in the letter) come to be ignorant of traditional forms of reproduction? How did the wider population of Graybor respond to the letter (if it was ever distributed)? 

Historians have little primary evidence to answer these questions. We know that the colony overthrew their heavily automated system of governance in NS14007 and banned ectogenesis and other reproductive technologies. But we do not know how these events unfolded nor do we know the status of the colony now. Nevertheless, as citizens of M4, we should consider this a cautionary tale regarding how AI-led reproductive technologies can be co-opted by those in power—including the computational entities we rely on.



## 4\. _Artefact 2:_ “Gender Reveal.”

_A scandal pop-up broadcast on Mantel-6α._

The second artefact is a single still image and one line of text in a screaming red typical of the scandal posts on Mantel-6a of the early NS14010s. It is a broadcast transmitted to wearable devices among the population of P2 who opted in for celebrity news alerts. It shows a fetus in an artificial womb that is filled with green fluid with a banner displayed diagonally reading: “Gender reveal gone wrong! You’ll never guess who made this TOXIC!!”

What is unusual about this particular scandal post is its reference to the ancient Earth practice of the “gender reveal” party. For this milestone, expecting parents would invite friends and family to a party that ritualistically assigned the fetus a prospective gender. For instance, the pregnant mother would cut a slice of cake whose interior was pink (“female”) or blue (“male”). (Cultural historians have found that the more dramatic gender reveal parties ended in fatalities from homemade bombs, forest fires, and even plane crashes.)<sup>4</sup>

According to anthropological studies, Mantel-6α is one of the only remaining human societies that still practices this old Earth custom. The adaptation of the “gender reveal” for use with assisted gestative technologies is interesting given the increased visibility of ectogenesis, compared with fetal development obscured by the human body. This would presumably make it more difficult to control the flow of information regarding the characteristics of the fetus.

This post is also evidence that the people of Mantel-6α also continued Earthlings’ custom of celebrity obsession. The announcement of this pop-up would also have been attended by a series of subcutaneous vibrations sent wirelessly to the recipient’s wearable device (Arciro) a phenomenon that many sociologists and medical scientists have labelled addictive. The dramatic message probably aimed to garner “outrage tokens” as a form of social capital. These tokens were typically collected by content creators and leveraged for advertising revenue from some of the larger news delivery broadcasters, who relied on these types of scandal posts for audience engagement. The presentational tactic is reminiscent of the older tradition of creating media “clickbait,” a technique popular among gossip journalists on Earth around eY2000-2030. In order to learn more about the alleged scandal, the recipient would need to open the post. There are no extant records from other news sources regarding the identity of the person responsible for tainting the synthetic amniotic fluid for this fetus. 

That ectogenesis has only been available to the wealthy using private facilities can explain why an accident involving the technology would be considered celebrity news. The unequal distribution of reproductive biotechnologies on Mantel-6α has been shown to exacerbate existing health inequities, particularly along socio-economic lines.<sup>5</sup> That previous focus group research suggests ectogenesis technology is viewed as a frivolous luxury by many P2 citizens is all the more concerning when considering the substantial health risks of biological pregnancy, especially those outside of Earth-normal gravity conditions and radiation protection. For the technology to be restricted to the socio-economic elite thus represents a major source of inequity.



## 5\. **_Artefact 3:_** **“FetEDU.”** 

_An Interactive 4D Image of a Fetus is shown developing in an Ectogenesis Chamber on Settlement M4._

The final artefact is an interactive digital object: a public, educational app, “FetEDU,” from the Health Administration of our home world, Settlement M4. Commissioning Guardians (those intending to start their family) are the primary users of the app, using it to contract a local reproduction facility. FetEDU, which was first launched in NS13945, is accessible free of charge from any data port on Settlement M4 and can be requested by individuals from other habitations for a small processing fee. 

FetEDU opens with a Chamber Technician describing the many benefits of ectogenesis technology to promote healthy fetal development. The script in the app is:


> “As Commissioning Guardians, you’ll enjoy the basic, universal benefits of ectogenesis. Our technology shields from teratogenic exposures (abnormalities of fetal physiological development caused by the environment); nutrition and oxygenation optimisation; and enhanced safety considerations, as you no longer need to gestate internally. 


> Our chambers also include benefits tailored to the environment of Settlement M4. Our chambers are engineered with a polyethylene-coated centrifugal motion machine to simulate Earth-normal gravity and provide enhanced radiation shielding. The former is necessary to ensure optimal skeletal development, while the latter is a particularly important consideration for inhabitants of M4, where there are no radio-protective features comparable to the Van Allen Belts that protect humans on Earth.”

In FetEDU, users can also view the developing fetus, which appears to be floating calmly in a cylindrical chamber filled with pinkish fluid and attached to two clear tubes. Users can also adopt the perspective of the fetus themself. Commissioning Guardians can view an accelerated depiction of fetal development at a rate of 20 intars per gestational month (equivalent to approximately three Earth minutes).

Artificial gestation has been widely embraced among the members of P3 and now accounts for the majority of human reproductive endeavours. The positive depiction of ectogenesis seen in the Settlement M4 health administration’s artefact represents how the technology has contributed significantly to safe methods of human reproduction, in which bearers avoid the risks of traditional childbirth. 

Language in the artefact is reminiscent of a pre-launch Earth that was limited to biological pregnancy. (_What to Expect When You’re Expecting,_ a pregnancy guidebook, is a good example of this genre.)

Normalising this technology within the M4 population relied on positive testimonials from early adopters and was significantly aided by public funding schemes that improved access, even while the technology was still considered experimental. Our community’s integration of ectogenesis into common, free use should be adopted by other eeSPs hoping to improve health and safety among their citizens.



## 6\. The Future of Humans & Ectogenesis

From promoting blanket bans to widespread acceptance, reproductive technologies on eeSPs often spark fierce ethical and political debate. This investigation, in which three different settlements have variously embraced or rejected the assisted gestative technologies first developed on Earth, demonstrates the range of approaches to human reproduction—and raises fundamental questions about human futures. While there are different motivations for each settlement’s current ethico-legal position on ectogenesis, the most important lesson from the study is this: Humans need to understand and monitor the control mechanisms dictating access and use of reproductive biotechnologies and to establish boundaries for what our shared human identity might entail.
