Axiom 1: The Emergence of Aliveness. 

Matter in the universe is constituted of atomic alliances that formed molecular communities millenia ago. Energy, and therefore liveliness, is present in all molecular communities. Thus, energy is not the source of aliveness. Aliveness occurs through desirous convergence of molecular communities. Molecules cross community domains and begin to move and perceive in synchronous alliance to form mobile convergent entities.

Urgent Message from ₻ to ₯ : Did you perceive the full global communique that came in just now from the Signalers in far orbit? In case you're still receiving down there at ocean depth, they say they perceived it first like a ripple. The smallest of energetic disturbances that reverberated the millennia of stillness between us and the Blue planet. Unlike the chemical play of regular solar ejecta or the wash of heat that announces an interplanetary weather event, this whispery ripple, according to the communique, was almost unobservable.

We were listening to fungi we found in a previously impossible-to-scale-ridge. You'd really love what we're doing over here. Of course, each of us retracted our perceptages wherever we were and came back to camp to commune properly because we were so overwhelmed by the news.

Remember when you were young, all those lessons each year about poor old Blue? The so-called "orderly planet"?  We can't believe we're witnessing witnesses to the arrival of real convergent boundary crossing disorder on that planet! We're still reverberating. It's a dream come true for anyone in the Seeking fields.

All the memories are flowing among us. Remember being so absolutely terrified by a planet stuck in the prehistory of convergence?  The horror of distinction, suspension, of a time before communing?  We remember being so obsessed about pre-ecogenesis, the paralyzing terror of it as the Elders described it. Or as it was portrayed in horror movies. Here's a haiku I turned into astronomy class one day -- on this occasion it seems funny now how emotional I got about that deadly planet. Feeling like what I imaged fungi to feel like being stuck on that planet without convergent bacterial partners. Thought you'd get a kick out of one we found by racking our thoughts along a reeaaally old memory network. Don't laugh.

                    Small sad still spores

                    Holed up alone in Blue's surface

                    When will we begin?

So cute, yeah?  

Message from ₯ to ₻:   It felt like a prickling to us.  A sense of excitement that was obviously different from the hydrothermal currents that thermoenergize us up from below. It felt like it was falling down from above, like an avalanche of atoms.

That unexpected reverb reminded me of what it meant to each of us to become a Seeker. As Seekers, we are supposed to relate to newness, supposed to make connections so that we may share our experiences with our Clusters. To Seek is to choose to encounter and relate to entities that are entirely different. So this signal we picked up feels like a warm unsettling and disequilbrium that makes alive our very being and makes this work bigger than us.  Reminds us of the old Elder scripture. Somehow this stanza feels like the right thing to send back to you in this moment:

We are our movement

Coming into contact

Choice unmakes order

Choosing catalyzes life

We live

We inside constituting move

There is a new kind of recognition of what that means, the idea of imagining when the mysterious energetic shift to convergence begins.

Your mention of memories sparked mine. There was that first time I went out Seeking. It's one thing to be young, surrounded by kin in your Cluster, there is a feeling that is as elastic as the skin that stretches across our outsides and as strong as the bonds that give definition to our form. Both skin and bonds keep us together. But it is a choice, to merge, interact, relate, engage beyond that Cluster. Our Cluster is a choice made with and across the porous forms of skin and bonds that make us up. That first time Seeking, I couldn't imagine the feeling, the high energy jolt that connecting with entities unconnected to our Cluster networks would be like. My oldest memory is of brushing by the coral that wend across the sands by the eastern shallows in the South Ocean. It was vibrant with the energy of its own distinct growth. Of the beings who have passed through the caverns it embodies, the fissures in its forms. We remember feeling a wash of energy. That memory of expansion through experience, and the simultaneous understanding about the catalytic potential of difference-convergence for making and sustaining life, stays with us to the core.

Message from ₻ to ₯ :  I feel everything you remember.  After our Seeker alliance got the first message about Blue's seeming field shift, we were sharing memories in the canyon fieldsite about what we learned in ecology class. All the debates about the inherent deadliness or potentialities of molecular homeostasis. Blue was the classic example in Sol's ecosystemic field: fields of rock and liquid and air energies were in their separate sameness.  In other words, totally unconvergent.  It was all so freaking toxic all that homeostasis on poor Blue, remember? Those posters in class about that potentially dead but beautiful world with all its ecological processes all happening in parallel but never disordering, never crossing, never knowing difference.  In the segregated deadness of total molecular alienation, molecules sticking only to each others' established communities. So hostile.  No sustained convergence across the basic molecular domains ever seemed to happened. In fact, said the teachers, we weren't sure it ever would out there on that hot lonely world.  I was truly sad about it because it was so beautiful out there.... Remember when we grew up and it felt, along all the sensing networks we had at that time, certain that Blue would stay hopelessly stuck. 

Even during advanced training we learned without a doubt that over there every molecular community was essentially hostile to one another.  The need to ally wasn't there yet, although teachers always got a little vague about why that was.  We remember the explanations, do you? Like: "Encounters among molecules never seemed to spark the commitment to sharing difference."  The whole thing about how molecules on Blue weren't yet evolved enough to tend toward cooperating far enough outside their fields to tip over into ecogenesis.  Protobacterial clumps would have to form, and then they would have to merge into sharing-based communities, blah blah blah.  So many contingencies!  It wasn't that there was something wrong with the energy field -- but the atomic level wasn't yet ecopoetic.  Even today we find the mystery beguiling -- the genesis of ecology, when singular molecular linearities converge into diversities that continue?  It's hard to imagine what that was like, but we will be witnessing it now.  

--------------------

Axiom 2: The Presence of Nurturance:  Nutrient molecules are present in nearly every nonstellar astronomical body. Aliveness occurs when molecular convergences convert nutrients to the processes of convergent nurturance. Nurturance is the ingestion and shared processing of external molecular matter by molecularly convergent entities.

------------------------

Message from ₻ to ₯ :  This is such a validation of what we're trying to figure out about Aliveness in the universe. We were so thrilled when the Signalers magnified the reverb. And then suddenly, it became that familiar electric feeling of when we encounter potential new kin. A movement in the slow, still, static. One among us wrote this:

Static no more

A promise of potential

Matter become energy become mattering

Sharing pluripotencies

Getting the now regular pulses of shared energies we feel the transitional capacities toward nurturance.  Even this field experience feels now so less unique to us here on this planet. When we received the messages we were sweeping over a spot on the ocean floor, intense heat from below warming our insides. We greeted the deep silent Shifter communities, who converted the heat so that we may be warmed and moved by it. Moving across our outers, the prickling sensation from Blue felt like each of us was expanding, becoming bigger and yet, also in becoming more we are becoming a smaller, more complex part of the pluriverse. 

A trembling now begins Inside us. The possibility that we are more than us here on this planet and the kin we can feel like a drawn out string beyond. We can barely contain ourselves! It really makes us pause and wonder, how much wider will our sense of lifes become?

We could feel the question bubble up even before it was expressed.  Perhaps we should go to the communing place. The rock formations there have a higher resonance, maybe we can learn more by attuning there to what the Signalers are sending. Would you want to meet to commune at the Elder Rock? It's midway between our Seeker groups now I think.

Message from ₯ to ₻:   Yes! Although that place has always put ourselves on edge, it's so high and steep. But you are right, if there is any place that can heighten our connection to the Signalers enough to feel the messages more deeply, it would be there.

We're processing this news together, appreciating the ocean floor is just shifting shades of green, and are thinking about nurturance beginnings.  We see small flares at the very bottom that light up the depths, Shifters working below in masses. They don't feel the messages as we do, their lives so tightly coupled with the chemical exchanges of their rock kin. When we swim closer we can feel bursts of needed energy, replenishing the heat output of our speed as it dissipates into the cold waters. Why are we rushing? There is something important to learn in the moments we experience as this news of emergence reaches us. Remember the old song?

A piece of the whole

Our whole, their whole

Axiom 3: The Presence of Molecular Interchange:  Sustained aliveness requires the capacity for a molecularly convergent entity to capture other molecules, deconstruct them, reorganize them into other molecules, then loosen and allow those to drift free. This process of interchange can happen within liquid space but also within free space. Liquid and solid molecular communities meet, collide, break, release and molecularly disaggregate to drift across space, enabling new potential connections and the possibility of convergent Aliveness.

---------------

Message from ₯ to ₻:   The Signalers are beyond the curve of our planet. We won't be able to hear them for some time.  We are allowing the current to move us onwards. The bright above has dimmed; leisurely, darkness begins to transform the brilliant blue of the waves into black. 

When was the last time you really felt into the dark as a place before ecopoesis? Not from fear, but genuine curiosity. The water's flow can keep us safe, the capacities of abundant nurturance animates our bodies. The darkness only makes us more aware of the water's sensation with us and what it loosens, the nutrients our bodies are in agreement about. The messages from the signalers prove that these chemical agreements can happen anywhere. Now we can sense the presence of interchange complexity at home and on Blue, and it is growing! 

It's interesting to feel the need to drift with the current but also to move together to reach our destination to meet up with you. We have to reorient ourselves. We are drifting as did the newly Alive molecular convergent entities long ago.  As light peels back the dimness, the colors of the water shift in hue, we feel the small beings that make the water glow letting off chemical sparks. We profoundly feel the exchanges of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,phosphorus,and sulfur as something miraculous. We know this is Seeker nerdiness at work, but really, we feel it.

Message from ₻ to ₯ :  The Communing rock seems even more sacred than before, don't you agree? Completely surrendering to the movement of the waves, we listen with a new reverence. To ourselves, here, and the tenuous cords of the beyond, to the sensory gradient that connects us all, humming.

From our altitude, we see the red rock formation in the distance. Around it are a series of cliffs, that wind like coral, around it. They seem even more lively than before. Tall cliffs, carved beyond memory before the waters came. Whatever had caused their formation left traces; fissures that held traces of metallic residues, burrow holes like corals. Places where nutrients were looser than ever, more available than before.

Turning the last bend before the entrance to the of the Communing rock, we're seeking in, we see you now. We feel your excitement vibrating toward us. Celebration time.  Blue is truly Alive.

Epilogue

The crunch of gravel resounded in the small cleft. The sky ua a narrow strip of light pink, far above, crowded by rust red cliff faces.

Rocks that had not been disturbed in millenia vibrate as the wheels of the Perseverance rover wend its way forward, turning a sharp corner around a jagged rock-face, maneuvering around a pile of larger boulders. Silver glints under a fine layer of dust. It was 8:19pm for the scientists in Pasadena, California, Earth.

Despite the close confines of the rocks, the rest of the journey to the next sampling spot is relatively straightforward. This part of the Martian topography, located in the northern hemisphere of the red planet was well imaged by Mariner V. The data from the orbiting imager had been the predominant resource used in the modeling of this part of Perseverance's journey.

Ahead, the onboard camera "recognized" the catacombed rock formation from satellite images. A shallow dip, easily navigable with the wide treds of the rover's wheels brings it directly to the formation's side. It rises over six meters high. Perseverance's camera is already snapping photos, rolling around the formation, reconnecting with its tracks after a few hours of careful documentation. Unlike the cliffs it had spent the better part of a month traversing, this formation has rounded edges. But not from wind, for the sheen of the formation betrayed a metallic component that was not present in the mineral composition of Mars. Perseverance's camera swivels to capture the base, of where formation meets surface. Ripples from where they had melted into each other pockmarks the ground for almost a meter.

The meteor at the base of the formation was from Earth, evidence of the long material exchange between the two planets, stretching back into aeons.

The rover's scoop scrapes against the rock formation's surface, and the fall of rock on rock sounds like rain. Into a small cylindrical cartridge went the geologic sample, Earth and Mars, and it was done.

Rumble, rumble, rumble. Sand grinds under rubber wheels and wind whistles faintly by, creating the semblance of waves hitting a beach. Unperturbed, Perseverance does not pause, rolling onward with an internal compass and set of algorithmic instructions to the next site. The next sample. Waiting for signs of life.
